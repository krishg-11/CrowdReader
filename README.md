# CrowdReader
Presentations will never be the same. In an instant, CrowdReader gives live feedback to the presenter on the reaction of the audience allowing them to adjust mid-speech and gain intel on the public. Utilizes AWS Rekognition.

## Inspiration
At school, we notice that teachers try very hard to adapt their teaching styles to advantage their students, but they unfortunately fail. When thinking about a way to fix this problem, we thought of a way to detect the emotions and engagements of students. We then thought more and realized this idea could be furthered to the political and business world for all sorts of speeches, presentations, and conferences.

## What it does
Our web app demos the ability to utilize machine learning to determine the holistic emotion of a crowd based on individual facial expressions.

## How we built it
We used Amazon Web Services in python to take in an image and produce confidence levels for various emotions. We took live images from our web app as input and manipulated our output into a graph to be visually appealing
